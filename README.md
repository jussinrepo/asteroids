# Asteroids - a space shooter game created with AI assistance

My third project featuring Claude 3.5 Sonnet creating the bulk of the code. Current features
- Newtonian physics
- Splitting asteroids
- Additional UFO, Comet and Magnetic Mine enemy types
- Unique Boss fights every 5 levels
- 20 levels total of increasing difficulty
- Powerups collected from destroyed asteroids
- Quite awful beep boop sfx which can luckily be turned off *(there's no sound in space after all...)*
- Cheats to enable easy testing *(you need to read the source to learn them!)*

# The project - coding without skill and depending on AI
- Spent about 4 weeks for now, around 0-2 hours per day, total estimate around 40 hours
- Tools used: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (coding, debugging code and idea pitching), Sublime Text 3 (first) and Visual Studio Code (later), PowerPoint (graphic design), python and pygame libraries
- Cost: $0, since you can use all the tools (Claude included!) for free
- Workflow: prompt, implement, test, ask for fixes, iterate, sleep
- Learned a lot about Python (previously coded with it over 15 years ago, so started with no knowledge)

# Game development with AI - pros and cons
- You can really start without knowledge, Claude 3.5 Sonnet produces quality code
- ...*but* you need to be interested in learning the code, otherwise it'll hit a wall soon
- Claude can refactor old scripts simply by drag-n-dropping a py file
- ...*but* you will soon hit the limit of it's context window
- Claude's Artefacts is REALLY cool feature
- ...*but* it consumes valuable context window, so turned it off midway of project
- Splitting the code to several smaller files is necessary (to make code fit into the context window)
- ...*but* Claude can help you with that, when asked
In short, the context window length is the most limiting and slowing down aspect of gamedev with Claude. Overcoming that is a pain.
